This application shows Image Encryption and Steganography for the medical Images and\n data encryption.\n

there is a button called Stegnography that you have to select for the \nImage Stegnography.\n

Before going for the stegnography, the data that is related to the particular image is \nencrypt by our implemented
algorithm know as AES algorithm \nin a background so you will recieve the encrypted data format to hide in the 
image.\n

this increses the security for the data and also user friendly to do the task.\n

after the selecting Stegnography, you have to upload 2 file that is Image file and Text file\n which is stored 
in the file manager.\n

the text file is encrypted patient data that we will hide behind the medical image.\n

after clicking on the submit you will store the output image in your file system and \nyou will see the msg that 
our file is submiited\n
also you can send the image via mail whomever you want to send but you have to fix one person to do that.\n

this is about the our system \n
Thank you\n
